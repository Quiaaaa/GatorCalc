		<center>FAQ</center><br>
		What does this do?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			You can use this calculator to determine the number of amalgamators that are obtainable depending on how
			much, and when you fuel.
			Since each Gator grants up to 1.5x attack along with a 40x health boost, it can be beneficial to get as many
			as are easily obtainable.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		How do I use this?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			Simply enter your stats or paste your save file to fill in the left-hand side of the screen. The right side
			results will automatically be calculated.
			The most important value will likely be the Max number of Amals you can get in a run.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		What do the numbers to the right of the DG levels mean?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			The numbers represent the efficiency of the next DG purchase. A higher number means you should purchase that
			upgrade first. This calculation uses your current run stats to
			determine how much MI is gained per run in order to determine how many runs are needed to afford each
			upgrade, and how much MI is lost through decay in the process. It then considers
			how much population gain each upgrade is worth on a push run (where population is fully utilized) and
			determines a Population gain per MI spent value for each upgrade. Results are
			finally each divided by the value of the Efficiency value for a normalized result.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		What does the table below the Results table mean?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			This table lists how many coordinations you would have to hold off buying in order to squeeze out an extra
			Amalgamator.
			So if the upper table told you to expect hitting 5 Amals at zone 501, it may be possible to keep your
			population:army ratio lower by withholding coordinations in order to get a 6th gator in the 501-600 range,
			or in the 600+ range.
			Keep in mind that this uses the "#Spires Cleared" value to determine if the needed ratio decreases after
			each spire.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		What do the buttons in the middle column do?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			These buttons are used to determine when it is optimal to fuel. They each provide sightly different bits of
			information that you can tailor your fueling preferences to.
			<br>The "Optimize" button will take the number of zones to fuel currently shown, and figure out the best
			starting zone to fuel in order to maximize population.
			<br>The "Minimize" button will try to determine the fewest number of zones you'd need to fuel for in order
			to get the maximum number of Amalgamators possible, thus maximizing MI gains. <br>The "Minimize - 1" button
			will do the same thing,
			but with getting 1 less Gator. This can be useful if you'd need to fuel for an entire run in order to get
			your Max number of gators, and you'd rather keep the MI gains.
			<br>The "Minimize at Zone" button will attempt to minimize, while ensuring you get your last Amalgamator by
			the specified zone. This is useful if you normally wouldn't get your final Gator until late in your run
			otherwise, as you will
			get the benefit of the extra Gator earlier.
			<br>The "Minimize Capacity" button also adjusts your capacity value to minimize number of zones to fuel.
			You'll need to use the in-game capacity slider to adjust to the recommended value.
			<br>The "Force Gator At Zone" button will determine how many coordinations you'd need to withhold from
			buying in order to get an extra gator on the zone specified. This will update the row of the corresponding
			zone in the table below the
			results table, but won't change anything else.
			<br>The "Coords Withheld" option allows you to set a certain number of coordination upgrades to refrain from
			buying, in order to get an extra amalgamator earlier or with less fueling than otherwise would be possible.
			<br>The "Withhold Coords Zone/Goal" option allows you to specify a certain zone to stop buying coordinations
			in order to reach the chosen goal number of amalgamators. These last two options can only be used
			separately, not together. This will
			also update the "Zones Withheld" result with the number of zones you have to hold off on buying
			coordinations, and therefore the number of coordinations behind you will be.
			<br>Finally, the "Use 5 zone breakpoints" tick will calculate updates to your Amalgamators only after every
			5th zone when they would die from an Omnipotrimp explosion. Without this option
			checked, most of the time new Amalgamators will show up on the zone after a spire, due to the ratio needed
			decreasing. However, as Gators are only updated on trimp death, if you survive after beating a spire for the
			next 5 zones (which
			you are likely to do if you're strong enough to have beaten it), then you would get 5 more coordination
			upgrades before your next death, which will increase your army size, and therefore the needed population for
			your next Gator, possibly
			pushing it beyond the population you've amassed.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		What assumptions are being made?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			This calculator assumes no population before you begin fueling. The population received before your first DG
			tick is inconsequential to your total population, and won't affect the results shown for the intended users
			of this page.

			The calculator assumes exactly 2.97 tauntimps received per zone, or 3.366 with the Randimp mastery, and an
			additional 0.0495 per level of More Imports. A 90% confidence interval is applied to ensure that the calc
			never shorts you on population, but accordingly, 90% of your runs will overshoot the stated total pop.

			The calculator assumes all DG ticks made are overclocks. This slightly affects the final results, especially
			for those with lower overclocker levels, as those non-OC ticks will be stronger that OC ticks, and happen
			earlier, therefore benefitting more from tauntimp compounding. However, the differences are still small, and
			largely unnoticable for fueling more than a couple of zones.

			This calculator assumes all fuel still in the tank after you stop fueling (and therefore stop overclocking)
			disappears. This causes the calculator to underestimate your total population by a bit, especially for
			fueling a smaller number
			of zones. This can be useful, as it provides a small cushion of extra pop to help ensure you get all the
			Gators you expect, even with poor tauntimp luck. However, with higher capacity values, it may determine that
			you need to fuel for longer
			in order to begin overclocking, in which case it may be best to use the in-game capacity slider to limit
			your max fuel and adjust the values of the calculator accordingly. Players with very high capacity levels
			may find the Minimize Capacity
			function useful, as this will suggest a setting for the fuel slider in order to maximize MI.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		I found an error, what can I do?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			Support is available on the Trimps Discord, you may be able to find some of the current and previous
			contributors there.
			Screenshots of your settings are helpful in diagnosing any technical issues.
		</span>
		<br><br>
		Is this up to date?<br>
		<span class="answer">
			This was last updated on October 19, 2022 and is up to date with Trimps patch 5.8.0
